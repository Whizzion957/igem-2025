          Cells interpret identical DNA sequences differently depending on the
          3D genome organization, leading to diverse cellular phenotypes and
          even determining between health and disease. While synthetic biology
          provides powerful methods to engineer the genome sequence, tools to
          sculpt the genome spatial architecture are lacking.
        </WikiParagraph>
        <WikiParagraph>
          We address this profound gap by introducing{" "}
          <WikiBold>PlCasS0</WikiBold>, a toolbox for rationally engineering
          the 3D genome organization. Using different CRISPR/Cas orthologs and
          new, engineered fusion guide RNAs, we created "Cas staples" that bind
          and connect otherwise non-interacting genomic regions.
        </WikiParagraph>
        <WikiParagraph>
          To streamline the development cycle of new Cas staples, we developed
          DaVinci, a multi-faceted model integrating both local and long-range
          DNA-protein interactions into a unified pipeline.
        </WikiParagraph>
        <WikiParagraph>
          Our comprehensive part collection and extensive education program
          enable the next generation of iGEMers to efficiently adapt PlCasS0
          and engineer genomes in 3D.

          All cells in our body carry the same genetic sequence, yet they have
          highly diverging and specialized functions. Even more, species that
          look and behave profoundly differently like humans and chimpanzees
          share almost identical genome sequences (Yang et al., 2019; Mikkelsen
          et al., 2005).

            The answer to this apparent contradiction lies, at least in parts,
            in another dimension used by living systems for information
            encoding: The 3D genome conformation. In fact, cells can interpret
            identical DNA sequences in various ways depending on their spatial
            genome organization.
